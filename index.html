      <h1>Boulder Cooperative Food</h1>
      <p>
        We are a member owned and operated bulk-food buying cooperative in Boulder, Colorado. We aim to give our members affordable access to simple, high quality food. We operate at cost, and keep costs low by doing the work ourselves and buying directly from producers and wholesalers. Our suppliers include <a href="http://www.goldenorganics.org/">Golden Organics</a>, <a href="https://www.frontiercoop.com/">Frontier Co-op</a>, <a href="https://m.costco.com/warehouse-locations/superior-co-480.html">Costco</a>, <a href="http://equalexchange.coop/">Equal Exchange</a>, and <a href="http://www.consciouscoffees.com/">Conscious Coffees</a>.
      </p>
      <h3>Membership</h3>
      <p>
        We are democratically governed by our members, and all members share in the economic benefits of the cooperative. Individual members pay a $25 equity share and institutional members pay a $250 equity share (refundable if they later choose to leave). This money supports our operations and allows us to place orders without relying on credit. While non-members can make purchases, they pay higher prices and cannot vote in elections. Becoming a member is worth it!
      </p>
      <h3>Logistics</h3>
      <p>
        We coordinate orders via an <a href="https://foodclub.org/bouldercoopfood/">online platform</a> and require electronic prepayment. Orders are placed every 2 to 8 weeks, depending on the supplier, and delivered to a central location <!--<a href="http://boulderhousingcoalition.org/houses/chrysalis/">Chrysalis housing co-op</a> (<a href="https://goo.gl/maps/Q1TXmJ7iwPr">map</a>)--> where volunteers receive and sort the products. Everyone is then invited to pick up their orders during designated pickup times.

        </li>
        <li><h5>Place orders</h5>
          To search for and add items to your order, select a supplier ("Select source") and click "Order", or use the global "Product search". The listed prices do not include markup (10% for members, 15% for non-members) and sales tax (3.86% for food, 8.845% for non-food). The order cycle proceeds as follows:
          <br /><br />
          <ol>
            <li>Place your order by the deadline.</li>
            <li>Either enable automatic payments or ensure <a href="https://foodclub.org/bouldercoopfood/member_credits">your prepaid balance</a> is equal to (or larger than) your <a href="https://foodclub.org/bouldercoopfood/view_cart">shopping cart total</a>. Both numbers are displayed at the top of the page.</li>
            <li>On the deadline, the order locks automatically.</li>
            <li>An admin generates invoices (only then are they visible to users), triggers prepayments ("pending charges"), and drops users with insufficient balances (and without automatic payments enabled).</li>
            <li>An admin submits the orders to our suppliers.</li>
            <li>Once the items are delivered and our suppliers paid, an admin finalizes the invoices and archives the orders. Sales tax and any price changes or out-of-stock items are automatically applied to user balances.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li><h5>Buy member equity shares</h5>
           Individual / household membership requires a (refundable) $25 equity share per adult (16+ years old) in a household. If you choose to buy these in installments, please email <a href="mailto:board@bouldercooperativefood.org">board@bouldercooperativefood.org</a> with your target number so that we know when to consider you a member. Institutional membership requires a flat (refundable) $250 equity share. You can add shares to your order at <a href="https://foodclub.org/bcf_internal/order_form">foodclub.org/bcf_internal/order_form</a>. Members pay a lower markup (10%) than non-members (15%).
